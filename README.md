# Snake with bombs

A game written entirely in python code using knowledge of object-oriented programming. 
It is a classic snake game where the goal is to eat as many dots as possible. 
Eating a pink dot increases the length of our snake, while eating a red dot, will cause the loss of one segment (point), it is a kind of bomb. 
As the game progresses, our score also changes on the scoreboard. 
The game ends when the snake's head hits the wall or touches its own tail.


Try to beat the best score and have fun !
